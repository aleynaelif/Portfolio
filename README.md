**Insp - The Food Inspector**

Consumers may not be conscious when shopping for food in their daily lives. In particular, they may be influenced by the advertisements of packaged and ready-to-eat foods and may prefer these foods. 
In addition, people's search for quick and practical solutions due to time constraints may cause them to shop unconsciously. While purchasing packaged foods, people who shop consciously can lose a 
lot of time while examining the labels. People with limited access to organic and fresh products should pay attention to the content of packaged and prepared foods. Conscious shopping is important 
in protecting people's health and developing a quality eating habit. This study is aimed at detecting the substances that people do not want to consume by scanning the contents of packaged foods 
by scanning the barcodes on the mobile application. Project aims to protecting consumer's health, making a careful choice, conscious consumption, accessing the right information, saving time and being environmentally friendly. It can provide many benefits, such as making better choices. Thanks to this application, people can make a more informed and accurate decision about the contents of packaged foods. 
This mobile application is designed to improve the shopping experience of people who cannot or do not want to consume every nutrient for certain reasons.

This project uses:
Firebase, SQLite, recyclerView, vievBinding, fragments, Picasso, ZXing library, OKHTTP3, butterknife, Nutritionix Api, Seo Api, Barcode Api, JSON, Web scraping, Flask, BeautifulSoup

**MusictifyApp**

 This project is a basic implementation of the app which is called Spotify.
 The app welcomes the users with the login screen. Users can easily sign up by using their email and password combinations.
 This project uses Firebase to store and verify the login information. If user types the correct combination, then the app opens.
 The homepage contains an options menu, and four bottons. Options menu allows users to create playlists or sign out. 
 The four buttons on the homepage are: liked songs, playlists, artists and albums. If users click on the liked songs button,
 then a fragment opens up. User can see the songs which I store in the firebase storage. The application receives this data 
 asynchronously from the Internet. Then, if users clicks on these songs, it starts to playing. User also can switch between the songs 
 and stops the song whenever he/she wants. If the user wants to create playlist, he/she can open the options menu and click the 
 create playlist button. It allows user to select a cover photo and give it a name. When the save button is pressed, the application 
 automatically opens the playlist page and you can see the data it saved here. The user can also view the artist and album the song belongs to.
 If user clicks the sign out button, application returns to the login page. 


 This project uses:
 MVVM, Firebase, SQLite, recyclerView, viewBinding, fragments, navigation, coroutines, Picasso, glide, dagger, hilt and exoplayer.

**Dora**

Work on this project is still ongoing. Image-based search engines are software that make it possible to search through images. These types of search engines help users find similar images by allowing them to search through images. Visual-based search engines are widely used, especially in areas where products are sold through images such as e-commerce platforms. In addition, these search engines can be used in a wide variety of industries. In this way, it helps users to learn about various information and trends. The working principles of image-based search engines are based on disciplines such as image processing and computer vision and information mining, and with the advancement of these disciplines,  can be further developed. This project will be realized by designing a user-friendly interface thanks to the mobile application, and it will be a platform that users can easily access from their mobile phones.

This project uses:

Web scraping, Pytorch, Flask, Firebase, Kotlin
