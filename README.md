**##Insp - The Food Inspector**

Consumers may not be conscious when shopping for food in their daily lives. In particular, they may be influenced by the advertisements of packaged and ready-to-eat foods and may prefer these foods. 
In addition, people's search for quick and practical solutions due to time constraints may cause them to shop unconsciously. While purchasing packaged foods, people who shop consciously can lose a 
lot of time while examining the labels. People with limited access to organic and fresh products should pay attention to the content of packaged and prepared foods. Conscious shopping is important 
in protecting people's health and developing a quality eating habit. This study is aimed at detecting the substances that people do not want to consume by scanning the contents of packaged foods 
by scanning the barcodes on the mobile application. Project aims to protecting consumer's health, making a careful choice, conscious consumption, accessing the right information, saving time and being environmentally friendly. It can provide many benefits, such as making better choices. Thanks to this application, people can make a more informed and accurate decision about the contents of packaged foods. 
This mobile application is designed to improve the shopping experience of people who cannot or do not want to consume every nutrient for certain reasons.
